				Doronila, a devout Catholic who had been planning a trip to Israel with friends from church, developed a cough in mid-March. One doctor told her she probably had strep throat; another said fever wasn’t high enough to merit a coronavirus test.<br>
				She offered to return to work, but as the days went by, her condition grew worse. On 21 March, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath. The next day, she was put on a ventilator. Two weeks later, she passed away.
			</p>		
			<p>Render said she and her mother were looking forward to sharing the next chapters in life together. For her mother, retirement at 65. For Rendor, marriage and perhaps starting her own family. <br>“It was about to get really, really good,” she said.</p>
