			<p>Paul Charon was a technologist working at the premier health Staffing. He was a devoted member of the Adirondack 46ers mountain club. Paul Charon would, without hesitation, clear branches that blocked a trail. When hikers left food wrappers in the bramble, he picked them up. 
When overflowing creeks obstructed a path, he bridged them.  The Saratoga Springs, New York, native  loved being one with nature , said his son, Kyle Charon.  He did all the unseen things to help out  so others could enjoy it, too.  Charon also spent over three decades with the Red Cross, where he volunteered during hurricanes, floods and wildfires across the country, Kyle said.  During quarantine, Charon dropped by his adult children's homes unannounced with gifts like a Dutch oven and a pull-up bar   he wanted to create a sense of normalcy for them.  As Covid-19 caseloads mounted, he continued caring for patients. From March to May, he performed X-rays at dozens of facilities near Rochester, Utica and Poughkeepsie. Friends on staff welcomed him with coffee, snacks and masks (he lacked sufficient protective equipment, Kyle said). Premier Healthcare Staffing did not respond to requests for comment.  On 9 May, feeling  a little down , Charon requested a pot of Kyle s signature vegetable soup. But it didn't help, and on 14 May, he was hospitalized. A few weeks later, after his father suffered several strokes and multiple-organ failure, Kyle signed a do-not-resuscitate order.
