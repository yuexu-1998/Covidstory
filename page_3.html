			<p>Joseph Bongiorno Sr. was a psychiatrist. He was working at Saint Joseph Hospital in Chicago for nearly a decade, and he chose to focus exclusively on private practice toward the end of his career. “He was a one-on-one type of person, you know, and I think that’s kind of why he decided to do what he did with the last years of his life,” His friend Dr. James Sullivan who was also working at Saint Joseph Hospital said. “He found the thing that made him happy.” Joseph Bogiorno’s work in healthcare took many forms. He served as a U.S. Air Force Medical Service Corps officer providing psychiatric service to Vietnam War returnees at Eglin Air Force Base. In 1974, he started his private practice in Illinois and also provided services to the Archdiocese of Chicago. Bongiorno was hospitalized in mid-March and died after being on a ventilator for over 20 days.“I’ve probably got 30 or 40 emails from patients who found out, and they all pretty much say that he saved their life with his help and changed their lives,” his son Joseph Jr. said. “He never ever, ever planned on retiring.” </p>
