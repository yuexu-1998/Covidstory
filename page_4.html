			<p>Kious Kelly was the first nurse known to have succumbed to Covid-19 in New York City. It was important to him that everyone was OK, and he always walked around the hospital with candy in his pockets. He was always the fixer. He always says to others,  At this point in my life, I think I just want to help people.  Kelly was the first group of nurses to work with the fist patient with Covid-19 symptoms, and he just became the assistant manager in Mount Sinaiâ€™s telemetry department. On 18 March, he became sick in the ICU and started getting trouble breathing. After 6 days, he passed aways.   </p>
