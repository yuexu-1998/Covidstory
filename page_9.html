			<p>Nina Forbes was a Licensed practical nurse at Silverado Alexandria Memory Care Community. She was very terrified of flying, and only took an airplane once in her life. However, even though she was scared of Covid-19, and as a nurse at an assisted living facility, she knew the virus posed a serious risk. Still, she continued showing up to work. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she refused to let fear stop her from saving other’s lives. Forbes tested Covid-positive just after Easter. Chills, body aches and a fever kept her from attending family dinner that Sunday. By the following weekend, she struggled to breathe and couldn’t walk on her own. An ambulance took her to the hospital. Her older daughter, Jessica, said her mother didn’t have the necessary protection at work. Forbes sometimes wore trash bags to protect herself, she said. In a statement, a representative for the facility said it met CDC guidelines for personal protective equipment. Employees sometimes used trash bags as an added layer of protection, worn over a disposable gown, according to the representative. Forbes appeared to do what she wanted even in her final moments.</p>
